## Baby steps into React    
This project was my first steps using React at Codeclan.

## Specification    

Here's a component from IMDB showing opening movies this week.    
![alt IMDB Progressive Web App Example](https://i.imgur.com/6EzSQmr.png)    

Draw out the skeleton of this app on paper.
Write down the names of the components and whether they have state or props.
For example:    

CommentBox - State:comments
.. CommentList Props:comments
... Comment Props:comment
... Comment Props:comment
... Comment Props:comment
.. CommentForm State:author, text Props:handleCommentSubmit(function)    

Once you've sketched this out, implement the IMDB component in React.
