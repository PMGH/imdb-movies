![alt IMDB Progressive Web App in React](homework/imdb/screenshots/imdb_app.png)  

## Baby steps into React    
This project was my first steps using React at Codeclan.

## Specification    

Here's a component from IMDB showing opening movies this week. ![alt IMDB Progressive Web App Example](https://imgur.com/6EzSQmr)    

Draw out the skeleton of this app on paper.
Write down the names of the components and whether they have state or props.
For example:    

CommentBox - State:comments
..* CommentList Props:comments
...* Comment Props:comment
...* Comment Props:comment
...* Comment Props:comment
..* CommentForm State:author, text Props:handleCommentSubmit(function)    

Once you've sketched this out, implement the IMDB component in React.
